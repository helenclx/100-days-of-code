### Day 67: 9 March 2024. Saturday

**Today's Progress:** Started building the cash register certification project for freeCodeCamp’s JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum.

**Thoughts:** This is the most challenging certification project I have done, in no small part due to how tricky to work with floats in JavaScript.

---

### Day 68: 10 March 2024. Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the cash register certification project for freeCodeCamp’s JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum.

I have completed the required functions in HTML and JavaScript to pass all the test, but I still need to finish the CSS before actually submitting.

**Thoughts:** Although I had completed the cash register project in the legacy curriculum, for the new curriculum, I initially tried to write the cash register function of the project from scratch, but I was unable to get my code pass all the tests.

Therefore, I decided to go back to my solution to the project in the legacy curriculum, revise and refactor the code so the output will be rendered on the web page.
