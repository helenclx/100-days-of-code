The log of Round 1 of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 3 January 2024, Wednesday.

## Log

### Day 1: 3 January 2024. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
- Completed freeCodeCamp's Learn Basic JavaScript by Building a Role Playing Game
- Completed Module 1 of Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path

**Thoughts:** I have taken frontend development courses on both freeCodeCamp and Scrimba, but with fCC's updated curriculum and my newly-activated Scrimba Pro plan that I won from the JavaScriptmas challenge in 2023, this is a great opportunity for me to practice and refresh my front end development skills and knowledge.

### Day 4: 6 January 2024. Saturday

**Today's Progress:**
- Completed and submitted [CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/)’s [Birthdays](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/9/birthdays/) problem.
- Set up [my own GitHub repository](https://github.com/helenclx/100-days-of-code) for the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

**Thoughts:** It was rather challenging to go back to CS50x and do its assignments after taking a break form the course for a while. My SQL and Flask knowledge got rusty due to rarely using them.

### Day 5: 7 January 2024. Sunday

**Today's Progress:** Built a digital business card as part of Module 2 of Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path. I also did the suggested stretch goals, including adding border radius, shadows, hover effects and animations.

**Thoughts:** This was a great opportunity to practice and refresh my CSS knowledge and skills. I learned tips to write a good image alt text and the trick to use clock direction to memorise margin and padding shorthand with four values: top, right, bottom, left.

---

### Day 9: 11 January 2024. Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Built a birthday gift site as part of Module 2 of Scrimba’s Frontend Developer Career Path.
