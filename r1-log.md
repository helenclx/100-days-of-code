The log of Round 1 of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 3 January 2024, Wednesday.

## Log

### Day 1: 3 January 2024. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
- Completed freeCodeCamp's Learn Basic JavaScript by Building a Role Playing Game
- Completed Module 1 of Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path

**Thoughts:** I have taken frontend development courses on both freeCodeCamp and Scrimba, but with fCC's updated curriculum and my newly-activated Scrimba Pro plan that I won from the JavaScriptmas challenge in 2023, this is a great opportunity for me to practice and refresh my front end development skills and knowledge.
